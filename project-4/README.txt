To run our code:

Run "python3 project.py" via command line.  This opens the pickle files "averages_training.pkl" and "averages_testing.pkl", which contain the original training and testing data with extra columns for the features we calculated and appended.  (If you'd like to generate that instead, uncomment out the first batch of lines in the main method of perfection.py - there are comments to indicate which lines in the file do what.). The file will then learn a model, and finally save the predictions to both a pickle file and a .txt file.  To view our predictions, open the text file "bde_ave.txt"; note that the top line has a hash mark at the beginning of it, so you may need to open the text file, delete this and save it, and then use this new version of the txt file if you're trying to parse it with code again (or submit to Kaggle).
