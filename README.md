Projects from Machine Learning

Project 1: Practicing with Python basics and getting our hands dirty with numpy. (Produces 4 pdfs of graphs).

Project 2: Creating evaluators, preprocessors, and learners.

Project 3: Getting our hands dirty with scikit-learn. Part 1: Using different classifiers to create decision boundaries. Part 2: Working with data and parameters.

Project 4: Class-wide Kaggle competition. 

Competition description: given a dataset of anonymized user data from a fake social media platform, learn a model to be able to predict a user's location (latitude and longitude).

Data given: user IDs, the first, second, and third most common hours they post on the platform, the number of times they've posted, latitude, longitude, and a graph of connections between "friends" on the platform.

Result: We placed 9th out of 30 participants, with a root mean squared error of 33.04552 (the best score was 30.98139).
